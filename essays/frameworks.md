**Extending one's html/css Arsenal**

I have been working with html ever since my first foray into coding. Creating a website was the normal final project of the school year, where everyone created a structured html page and styled it with css code in another file, and maybe some javascript modifications as well. Although it was not very technically challenging, it was tedious to repeatedly style my text containers with css using the same set of extended css code. I was surprised at how long my css code turned out to become by the end of the project. Frameworks were out of the question, as I had very little knowledge of how they worked, although I knew they existed. Before this month, I had never used front-end software development frameworks and was unsure of their purpose in coding, or why there is so many of them. However, now that I have used them to construct my page, I now understand their significance in the tech industry.

**The Problem with Raw Implementation**

From my final project completed in my time before college, I knew how long css code could get in terms of the number of lines. At that time, I didn't mind it as it was just a simple multipage website project with myself deciding whether something looked good enough or not. Since my rubric was my own standards, I didn't mind spending extra time writing out all the extra lines of code for a better-looking website or text. Now that I've gained a good deal of experience, I understand that there are many cases where the person that decided if one's work is good enough is not that person itself. In fact, they are likely to have a strict set of guidelines not just for single webpage, but also for tens if not hundreds of webpages depending on the scope of the company-wide project. In this case, efficiency is very important as the overall image of the website is valued above each individual page, and the time for constructing each individual page with ordinary, raw tools may be very time consuming. I experienced this just from copying the layout of the UH MƒÅnoa information page for the Data Science Certificate. Without using a html/css/js framework like Bootstrap, I would have to include a sizeable css file.

**Lifting one's Work up by the Bootstraps**

Bootstrap 5 allows a programmer to easily create appealing websites and web-applications without engaging with css code. I have not mentioned which screenshot is of the original and which screenshot is of my recreation yet. After checking out the original website, you may decide for yourself which one is of a better design. Thanks to this discovery of these frameworks and Bootstrap 5, I am able to easily take my website design to the next level.
