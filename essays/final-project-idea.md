## Overview 

As a fellow student attending the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, I have often wished for a piece of equipment I needed for one of my classes, a private room for a study group, or another student that could benefit from my old material used in past computer science classes. Glancing at the ideas proposed in the final project brainstorm outline, my group and I knew that we could add a new fundamental website project designed to help UH Mānoa students obtain common campus resouces. Therefore, we propose **Campus Resource Scheduler** as our final ICS 314 project.

### The Problem

As students attend their everyday classes at UH Mānoa, they may forget to bring an important piece of equipment once or twice, such as a mouse, earbuds, pencil, or even a laptop to a specific place. Students may also want specialized technology for a few impotant occasions such as a significant meeting, challenging recitation, or crucial exam, but do not know where to go to obtain them. Additionally, students may want a specialized room or lab to study, conduct work, or work on projects in, but they cannot find such a place easily.

### The Solution

As a web project cenetered around the UH Mānoa community, the **Campus Resource Scheduler** seeks to solve these problems by providing a central hub where common campus resources, rooms, and labs can be lent out to those in need of these resources. Students can choose between what kind of resource they would like to receive for a set duration of time, regulated by the usage of accounts for authentication. Students will be able to see what resources and rooms are available or not as they access the website and return resources for community use. 

## The Group Behind the Project

This is the group that will be working on the **Campus Resource Scheduler**.
- Arthur Acenas (https://acenasa.github.io/)
- Eric Chae (https://ericc808.github.io/)
- Sungwon Han (https://hanswhan.github.io/)
- Zeyao Zhou (https://zeyaoz.github.io/)

## Mockup Page Ideas

This project will be structured similar to a renting/borrowing website with a central authority who manages what items can be borrowed and who can borrow them. 

**Roles:** 
Users will be able to log into the website, browse the directory for resources that are relevant to them through a specialized search function, and reserve items or rooms for later pick up and use. 
Site Admins will be able to monitor the users that log into the website, see what resources they have used and borrowed, manage who can borrow what item, and add additional functionality to the website itself.

**Components:**
There will be 2 main categories for equipment and physical spaces. These 2 main catgories will also have their own subcategories based on types such as electronics for equipment or labs for physical spaces. Users will be able to choose what specific resource they would like to schedule for a set amount of time, and filter various resources based on relevance and availability. The users can receive confirmation messages and updates through their via their school email. Photos will be provided of all the resources for a friendlier user experience. Website administrators will be able to modify all of these components to fit the needs of the community, as well as make modifications based on real-life updates at UH Mānoa.

**Possible Mockup Pages:**
- Landing Page
- User Home Page
- User Profile Page
- Website Introduction Page
- Equipment Page
- Borrow Equipment Page
- Return Equipment Page
- Rooms/Labs Page
- Rent Rooms/Labs Page
- Return Rooms/Labs Page
- Admin Home Page
- Configure Resourced Page

## Use Case Ideas

An end-to-end scenario of using the system:
- New user enters landing page, signs up, logs into the system, and sets up their profile.
- New user learns how to use the site through a introductory page they encounter before scheduling resources.
- User searches for specific item/room based on their needs.
- User schedules item/room successfully and receives a confirmation message and instructions for pickup.
- Admin enters landing page, logs into the system, and monitors website activity.
- Admin modifies the availability of spcific items/rooms based on current events.

## Beyond the basics

After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:
- An option for users to put up their own resources to contribute as a common campus resource.
- A timeline for each item's availability if unavailable on certain periods of time and when they will be available again.
- A page to report any issues or concerns with borrowed equipment/locations.
- Notify users through email or SMS when a particular resource is available for scheduling.
