## Overview 

As a fellow student attending the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, I have often wished for a piece of equipment I needed for one of my classes, a private room for a study group, or another student that could benefit from my old material used in past computer science classes. Glancing at the ideas proposed in the final project brainstorm outline, my group and I knew that we could add a new fundamental website project designed to help UH Mānoa students obtain common campus resouces. Therefore, we propose **Campus Resource Scheduler** as our final ICS 314 project.

### The Problem

As students attend their everyday classes at UH Mānoa, they may forget to bring an important piece of equipment once or twice, such as a mouse, earbuds, pencil, or even a laptop to a specific place. Students may also want specialized technology for a few impotant occasions such as a significant meeting, challenging recitation, or crucial exam, but do not know where to go to obtain them. Additionally, students may want a specialized room or lab to study, conduct work, or work on projects in, but they cannot find such a place easily.

### The Solution

As a web project cenetered around the UH Mānoa community, the **Campus Resource Scheduler** seeks to solve these problems by providing a central hub where common campus resources, rooms, and labs can be lent out to those in need of these resources. Students can choose between what kind of resource they would like to receive for a set duration of time, regulated by the usage of accounts for authentication. Students will be able to see what resources and rooms are available or not as they access the website and return resources for community use.
