// Should we all strive to achieve the best result using any means necessary?

# I. Introduction

Artifical Intelligence has been proclaimed to be the new revolutionary technology of the 21st century, and it is no surprise why. Instant, all-encompassing, and non-judgemental answers to any problem one could ask it, software engineering related or not. Given that this technology is redily available to anyone with an internet connection, it is inevitable that this "magic answering machine" has become entrenched in Software Engineering circles such as ICS 314. As a current student of a public university, I too have been encouraged to utilize and employ AI in the form of ChatGPT in ICS 314 - Software Engineering I to complete tasks, assignments and exams. Here I will explore whether I chose to utilize AI in these aspects, and the wider implications of AI usage in software engineering.

# II. Personal Experience with AI:

There are many facets of software engineering that can be complimented with AI. Here are some of those ways that I could have used AI in ICS 314 and whether I chose to or not.

### 1. Experience WODs e.g. E18

I have used AI for this element. It was very successful in finding the right answers as I provided the AI with clear and comprehensive instructions. The main motivation for using AI here is the desire to find a way to complete the WOD in the best way possible. AI is known to provide high-quality answers (albeit with some guidance), so I was motivated to use AI for experience WODs in pursuit of the best output.

### 2. In-class Practice WODs

I have used AI for this element. Although there is less pressure to find the currect answers in practice WODs, It was still important to me that I found the right ways to do a task. AI helped me in this endeavor by providing a solid answer which I used without having to look through documentation online and construct my own answer. Again, the desire for finding a correct, high-quality answer played a role in my williness to use AI in this aspect.

### 3. In-class WODs

I have used AI for this element. The time pressure of completing an in-class WOD on time is a major motivation factor for using AI in this aspect. As WODs account for a major part of the overall grade of ICS 314, I did not pass up on this opportunity to product the best possible answer and earn a desirable grade. Athough AI outputs often needed revisions or tweaks to achieve a quality output, It was easy to execute given that I had the preliminary knowledge and intuition gained from experience WODs and practice WODs.

### 4. Essays

I have never used AI for this element. There was no time pressure to finish essays in a short timeframe, so the only limiting factor for producting a quality essay was how much time I decided to put into this aspect. Throughout my entire academic career, I have prided myself in being able to communicate my thoughts and ideas clearly and effectively through both pencil or keyboard. As I always spend a substantial period of time constructing each of these essays, I have never thought of using AI as then I would be revising someone else's essay to submit rather than just communicating my own thoughts directly. I do not see myself using AI for writing tasks from now till the end of my career, as there is always time for me to communicate.

### 5. Final project

I have used AI for this element. As a student of UH Mānoa, it was unchallenging to create and plan for a project that applied to the wider UH community. I could apply my own experiences from daily university occurences or past courses to contruct and document my own final project. I used AI in constructing code for specific parts of the final project, as it served as a good starting point for further functionality additions. Since I am motivated to use every tool at my disposal to complete the project as competently as possible, I regularly used AI for this aspect.

### 6. Learning a concept / tutorial

I have never used AI for this element. Traditional methods of learning such as reading documentation or watching screencasts have always been more digestible to me, so I never had a reason to use AI in this aspect. Rather than spending time learning a concept through a intermediary, I decided to receive my information directly from the source material of various subjects and topics. 

### 7. Answering a question in class or in Discord

I have never used AI for this element. I believe that to answer a question asked by another student, one must be competent in that subject without having to consult other resources. Therefore, I will never use AI to answer someone else's question or give someone else an answer that was AI-generated. All answers will therefore have come from my own analysis and reasoning. This way, I will be better equipped to handle follow-up questions or requests to expand on my reasoning.

### 8. Asking or answering a smart-question

I have never used AI for this element. Since I am competent at writing, I will never ask AI to write questions for me to ask. In regards to answering question, my response above still applies to this aspect. All my answers to questions have been made from a point of comprehension of the topic at hand, and I will not give responses if I still have to ask for the same responses from AI. If I had to ask AI to answer a question, it would be more advantageous for the recipient to ask AI themselves, and remove the middleman.

### 9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”

I have never used AI for this element. I prefer to construct my own coding examples, as I can use traditional sources of learning such as documentation to reinforce my understanding of these subjects. Therefore, I did not need to use AI for an apsect of coding that I can perform very well myself.

### 10. Explaining code

I have used AI for this element. Most commonly, I will ask AI to explain the code that it has generated itself in order to get a better understanding of it. I will not ask AI to explain my own code as I would not have written it had I not understood it. Therefore, this aspect is mainly a expansion of using AI for the purpose of WODs or projects, as it is extrememely detrimenal to one's learning if they do not understand the material they submit.

### 11. Writing code

I have used AI for this element. WODs and the final project are all places where I have asked AI to write code, as I want to see the answer it provides and compare to see if it is beneficial to be used in my work. As a major aspect of ICS 314, AI was helpful in producing quality code after a few revisions and enhancements. 

### 12. Documenting code

I have never used AI for this element. Since I am competent at writing, I prefer to write my own documentation as I understand the code that I wrote the best. If I was to ask AI to document this code, I would need to revise the document to make it intelligible for me, which takes extra time compared to if I were to document my own code myself. This aspect of coding is also very enjoyable for me to complete, so I would not hand it off to AI only to revise it to the image that I want it in later.

### 13. Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>”

I have used AI for this element. Most commonly, I will ask AI to conduct QA testing on its own code that it has generated itself to fix any problems that could arise. If I did not do this, I would be left with unusable and broken code, which is undesirable. I would also ask AI in the QA aspect to hear a second perspective on potential problems and issues that may arise in code. 

### 14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed

I have not used AI for this element. All of the aspects listed above are all of the potential points where I might have used AI, and is all-encompassing in terms of my involvement in ICS 314.
